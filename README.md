# node-learn-regex

## What is this?

*node-learn-regex* is a repository whose purpose is to demonstrate a variety regular expressions and teach you how to use them. It will give a firm grasp on how to make simple to intermediate regular expressions. The best way to follow this course is to start at 01 and continue on in order. 

## Why make this?

This repository is yet another regular expressions tutorial. It's primary purpose is my own personal notes, but it is provided here for anyone who wants to follow the same path that I took, or anyone who wants a specific regular expression that I created in the course of learning regular expression. All the code here is fully runnable and easy to manipulate or modify without weeding through a bunch of non-essential node code. So if any of that sounds useful then feel free to use this repo however you'd like.

## How do I use this?

- `git clone <this-repo>`
- `cd <lesson/of/interest>`
- `node run.js`

## I found a problem!

Great, please raise an issue or create a PR.

## Project Structure

the lessons themselves are in the form of source code. Each `run.js` if piped into a file should make for an excellent test of understanding simply comment out the answer lines and send the output to someone want to wrap their head around RegEx. 

The source code and examples should build on each other while still remaining focused on the task at hand. The comments before each example describe what should happen. If a test is supposed to fail there will be a note in the source code comments and the example description will say why. 

To see some simple use cases for what you will learn here take a look at the common examples folder. Please note, that while these examples cover a great many permutations of the entities they claim to cover they are not perfect (the intent is to wrap your head around how RegEx works and how you could go about making the pattern more and more robust).
